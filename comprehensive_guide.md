## Introduction

This comprehensive guide provides instructions for developing and deploying a multiplayer tower defense game similar to Bloons TD 6, with support for up to 6 players simultaneously. The game will be deployed on a Hostinger VPS using Dokploy for container management.

The guide covers:
- Research on tower defense game mechanics
- Selection of appropriate frontend and backend technologies
- Design of a scalable multiplayer architecture
- Step-by-step development instructions
- Detailed deployment procedures for Hostinger VPS with Dokploy

## Game Mechanics Research

Our research on Bloons TD 6 and tower defense games revealed several key mechanics that will be implemented in our game:

### Core Gameplay Elements

- **Tower Placement**: Players strategically place defensive towers on a map
- **Enemy Waves**: Progressively difficult waves of enemies follow predefined paths
- **Tower Upgrades**: Multiple upgrade paths for each tower type
- **Resource Management**: Players earn and spend in-game currency
- **Special Abilities**: Unique abilities for different tower types
- **Map Variety**: Different maps with varying difficulty and path layouts

### Multiplayer Implementation

Bloons TD 6 supports 2-4 players in Co-Op mode, but our implementation will extend this to support 6 players with the following features:

- **Shared Map Space**: Players share the game map, with specific areas assigned to each player
- **Resource Sharing**: Players can exchange resources with teammates
- **Synchronized Game State**: Real-time synchronization of game state across all players
- **Match Types**: Support for public matchmaking and private games
- **Player Roles**: Different responsibilities or specializations for team members

For more details, see the [full research document](bloons_td6_research.md).

## Technology Stack

Based on our research and requirements, we've selected the following technology stack:

### Frontend Framework

- **Game Engine**: Phaser 3
  - Mature and stable HTML5 game framework
  - Performance-focused with hardware acceleration
  - Rich feature set including physics, animation, and asset management
  - Strong community support and documentation

- **UI Framework**: React
  - Component-based architecture for modular UI development
  - Virtual DOM for efficient rendering and updates
  - Rich ecosystem of libraries and tools
  - Seamless integration with Phaser

- **Application Framework**: Next.js
  - Server-side rendering for improved performance
  - API routes for backend functionality
  - Simplified routing between game screens
  - TypeScript support for type safety

For more details, see the [frontend framework selection document](frontend_framework_selection.md).

### Backend Framework

- **Server Framework**: Node.js with Express
  - JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem for frontend-backend consistency
  - Non-blocking I/O for efficient handling of concurrent connections
  - Well-suited for real-time applications

- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io
  - WebSocket support with fallback mechanisms
  - Room management for game sessions
  - Efficient message broadcasting
  - Horizontal scaling capabilities

- **Database**: MongoDB
  - Flexible schema for evolving game data
  - JSON-like documents that work well with JavaScript
  - High performance for read/write operations
  - Good support for real-time data changes

- **Containerization**: Docker with Docker Compose
  - Isolated application components
  - Consistent deployment environments
  - Easy scaling of individual services
  - Compatible with Dokploy for orchestration

For more details, see the [backend framework selection document](backend_framework_selection.md).

## Multiplayer Architecture

Our multiplayer architecture is designed to support 6 players simultaneously with low latency and consistent gameplay:

### Client-Server Model

The game uses a client-server architecture where:
- The server maintains the authoritative game state
- Clients send player actions to the server
- The server validates actions and updates the game state
- Clients receive state updates and render the game accordingly

### Game Room Management

- Players can create or join game rooms
- Each room supports up to 6 players
- Players are assigned to specific areas of the map
- The server maintains state for each active game room

### State Synchronization

- Server-authoritative game state with client prediction
- Tick-based updates for consistent gameplay
- Delta compression to minimize network traffic
- Interpolation for smooth visual representation
- Reconciliation to resolve conflicts between client and server states

### Scaling Strategy

- Horizontal scaling with multiple game server instances
- Socket.io adapter layer for managing connections across instances
- Load balancing for distributing incoming connections
- Session affinity to keep players in the same game on the same server

For more details, see the [multiplayer architecture document](multiplayer_architecture.md).

## Development Guide
