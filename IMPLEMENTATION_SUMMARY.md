# Tower Defense Game Implementation Summary

## What Has Been Implemented

We've successfully built the foundation for a 6-player tower defense game with the following components:

### Frontend
- **Next.js Application Structure**: Pages for main menu, game, tutorial, and settings
- **React Components**: UI components for game lobby and main game
- **Phaser Game Integration**: Core game setup with scenes and objects
- **Game Objects**: Tower and Enemy classes with all necessary mechanics
- **User Interface**: Game UI for tower selection, resources, and player information

### Backend
- **Express Server**: API endpoints for users and games
- **Socket.io Server**: Real-time communication for multiplayer functionality
- **Game Logic**: Game state management and synchronization
- **Room Management**: Lobby system for creating and joining game rooms
- **Game Mechanics**: Tower placement, enemy waves, attacking logic, etc.

### Game Assets
- **Asset Requirements**: Detailed specifications for all required game assets

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation, the following steps need to be taken:

1. **Asset Creation**:
   - Create or acquire all assets listed in `game_assets_requirements.md`
   - Place assets in the appropriate directories within `/public/assets/`

2. **Testing**:
   - Test multiplayer functionality with multiple clients
   - Test game mechanics like tower placement, enemy movement, and attacking
   - Verify synchronization between players

3. **Polish**:
   - Add animations and effects for smoother gameplay
   - Implement sound effects and background music
   - Add visual feedback for player actions

4. **Deployment**:
   - Set up MongoDB for persistent storage (currently using in-memory storage)
   - Create Docker containers for the application
   - Deploy to Hostinger VPS using Dokploy as specified in the requirements

## How to Run the Project

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development servers:
```bash
npm run dev:all
```

3. Access the game at http://localhost:3000

## Known Limitations

- Asset files are currently missing and need to be created/acquired
- In-memory storage is used instead of MongoDB for simplicity
- Game balance may need adjustment after testing
- Mobile support is not yet fully implemented

## Features That Could Be Added Later

- Player accounts and authentication
- Leaderboards and statistics
- Additional maps and tower types
- Tower special abilities
- More enemy types and behaviors
- In-game chat system
- Custom game modes

The project has a solid foundation and is ready for asset integration and testing. With the current implementation, you can create and join game rooms, place and upgrade towers, and battle against waves of enemies in a multiplayer environment.
